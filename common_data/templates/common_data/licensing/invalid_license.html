            <p>The application cannot proceed because an error was detected in the current license.</p>
            <p>The error could be caused by 
                <ul>
                    <li>An licence that is no longer valid. Bentsch is licenced for a limited time and needs to be renewed. Please contact the vendor if that is the case </li>
                    <li>The licence file has been tampered with. The license file must not be altered otherwise it is instantly invalidated.</li>
                    <li>The license file belongs to another machine. Each license is linked directly to the applicant's machine and will not work elsewhere.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>If any of these factors have contributed to the current issue, please email the vendor with a new 'key.txt' file.</p>
            <p>The application has automatically generated a hardware id that you can email to the vendor and receive a licence key if you applicable. The location of this file is: <br> <i>'{{dir}}\key.txt'</i></p>
            <p>Please navigate to the application directory and email your hardware ID to the vendor <sup>*</sup></p>
